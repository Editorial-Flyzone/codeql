  /**
   * A phi-read node.
   *
   * Phi-read nodes are like normal phi nodes, but they are inserted based on reads
   * instead of writes, and only if the dominance-frontier block does not already
   * contain a normal phi node.
   *
   * The motivation for adding phi-reads is to improve performance of the use-use
   * calculation in cases where there is a large number of reads that can reach the
   * same join-point, and from there reach a large number of basic blocks. Example:
   *
   * ```cs
   * if (a)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (b)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (c)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (d)
   *   use(x);
   * // many more ifs ...
   *
   * // phi-read for `x` inserted here
   *
   * // program not mentioning `x`, with large basic block graph
   *
   * use(x);
   * ```
   *
   * Without phi-reads, the analysis has to replicate reachability for each of
   * the guarded uses of `x`. However, with phi-reads, the analysis will limit
   * each conditional use of `x` to reach the basic block containing the phi-read
   * node for `x`, and only that basic block will have to compute reachability
   * through the remainder of the large program.
   *
   * Another motivation for phi-reads is when a large number of reads can reach
   * another large number of reads:
   *
   * ```cs
   * if (a)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (b)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (c)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (d)
   *   use(x);
   * // many more ifs ...
   *
   * // phi-read for `x` inserted here
   *
   * if (a)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (b)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (c)
   *   use(x);
   * else if (d)
   *   use(x);
   * // many more ifs ...
   * ```
   *
   * Without phi-reads, one needs to add `n*m` data-flow edges (assuming `n` reads
   * before the phi-read and `m` reads after the phi-read), whereas if we include
   * phi-reads in the data-flow graph, we only need to add `n+m` edges.
   *
   * Like normal reads, each phi-read node `phi-read` can be reached from exactly
   * one SSA definition (without passing through another definition): Assume, for
   * the sake of contradiction, that there are two reaching definitions `def1` and
   * `def2`. Now, if both `def1` and `def2` dominate `phi-read`, then the nearest
   * dominating definition will prevent the other from reaching `phi-read`. So, at
   * least one of `def1` and `def2` cannot dominate `phi-read`; assume it is `def1`.
   * Then `def1` must go through one of its dominance-frontier blocks in order to
   * reach `phi-read`. However, such a block will always start with a (normal) phi
   * node, which contradicts reachability.
   *
   * Also, like normal reads, the unique SSA definition `def` that reaches `phi-read`,
   * will dominate `phi-read`. Assuming it doesn't means that the path from `def`
   * to `phi-read` goes through a dominance-frontier block, and hence a phi node,
   * which contradicts reachability.
